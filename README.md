# Fourty years of Terrorism

## Introduction
Introduction to Data Analysis on the Global Terrorism Database

In an increasingly interconnected world, the threat of terrorism remains a pressing concern for governments, organizations, and individuals worldwide. To combat this threat effectively, it is essential to understand the patterns, trends, and underlying factors associated with acts of terrorism. Data analysis plays a pivotal role in this process by providing valuable insights into the complexities of terrorist activities.

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) stands as a comprehensive and authoritative source of information on terrorism incidents worldwide. Developed by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), the GTD offers a vast collection of data spanning several decades, making it a valuable resource for researchers and analysts.

The purpose of this data analysis is to delve into the GTD and extract meaningful information that can shed light on the nature and dynamics of terrorism. By employing various analytical techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, identify hotspots, explore temporal trends, and gain insights into the motives and methods employed by terrorists.

One of the primary goals of this analysis is to identify significant trends in terrorist activities over time. By examining the temporal patterns, we can assess whether terrorism has increased or decreased, identify periods of heightened activity, and uncover potential factors that may have influenced these fluctuations. Furthermore, by investigating the geographical distribution of terrorist incidents, we can pinpoint regions that are particularly vulnerable and may require targeted interventions.

In conclusion, this data analysis on the Global Terrorism Database presents an opportunity to uncover valuable insights and patterns within the complex landscape of terrorism. By leveraging this rich dataset, we can contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat terrorism, promote global security, and foster a safer world for all.


## Files 

EDA.ipynb: A juypter note book that goes over the main points of the data set and explores terrorism in diffrent countrys

terrorism_map.html: A map box html file that makes an intercative heat map on terrorism attacks over the years and provides some detail on the attacks. You will have to download the file and open it in your browser of choice to view the file. I would recomend you do this because it is a very intuitive way to gain insite on terrorism across time and space.


dash_board.twbx: A tablaue document that goes over the same points in the EDA but does it a little neater.

data/: A folder that has the zip file of the data we are looking at, that will be ran with a script to filter out stuff we dont need.

scripts/: Just some python files to unzip the data and drop some columns to allow the data to be stored on github.
